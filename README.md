# Nagmap Reborn Project
Nagmap Reborn interconnects directly with the information generated by the monitoring systems, providing a user-friendly interface for monitoring servers and services, through geographic visualization on the map.

Making it possible to easily and visually identify the status of what is monitored, it is also possible to view summary information about each host, in addition to some exclusive features

<sub>Nagmap Reborn is based on Nagmap project developed by [Marcel Hecko](https://github.com/hecko).</sub>

## v2.x.x
This version brings significant logical changes, being a break-point in the API compatibility between v1.x.x and v2.x.x.

With these changes it was possible to achieve the following objectives:

* Use of modern technologies;
* Separation of front-end and back-end;
* Maintenance facilitation;
* Better performance and scalability (Handles large installations well);
* A bunch of new cool features;
